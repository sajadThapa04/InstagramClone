# InstagramClone


#This is instagram app clone buid by me

it got basic functionality log in and sign up 
uploading images and creating new profile 

it is using firebase and kingfisher packages

also i am using the new Swift Ui SDK

you can download this repository 

after you download this repository 

you have to create a firebase account 
https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/


and include the bundle identifier 

also have to add different packages like firebase Auth firebase storage and firebase swift storage 

after you  install the firebase package on the Appdelegate file you have to add the firebaseApp.configure() method which you can see on my InstagramAppClone app main file
you also have to include the kingfisher app file 

everything is stored on firestore database any changes to the app like creating account and 
log in and sign up will be reflected on firebase.

Thanks again for visiting and reading the profile
